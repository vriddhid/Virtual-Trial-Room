# Virtual-Trial-Room


For the past few years, e-commerce has changed the way people buy and sell products. People use this business model to do business over the Internet. We search for most products, based on product features, for instance colour or pattern of a T-shirt. Furthermore, a growing number of consumers rely on social media to make a purchasing decision. They try to find out what is trending right now and look for similar items. Online shopping has certainly replaced the traditional way of shopping for daily goods and clothing. Here, they enjoy easy access to an attractive price range, prompt customer support, and free home delivery. There is no doubt that these are some of the attractive features that catch the attention of the consumers. Although there is one small issue that could make people lose interest in online shopping, it might not be possible to try-on clothes in such cases. Our motive here is to increase the time efficiency and improve the accessibility of clothes by creating a virtual dressing room environment. A real time virtual dressing room system which consists of multiple tasks including detection of the userâ€™s face from video stream, alignment of models, approximating the position of torso and lower body based on face detection and resizing input dress images and dress up using Image Processing.
